# Rules for using Git in this project:

  
* New features will be implemented in feature branches, these branches must be created from the development branch and be named feature/name_of_feature.

* The development branch can only be merged into by creating a merge request with a feature branch as source branch. This requires the approval of one other project member. Developers will not be allowed to push directly to this branch.

* The master branch can only be merged into by creating a merge request with the development as source branch. This requires the approval of two other project members. Developers will not be allowed to push directly to this branch.
